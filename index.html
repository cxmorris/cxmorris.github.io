		<h2>About me</h2>
	<div class="about">
		<p>
			I am a freshman intending to study computer science at Harvard University. I am currently involved with <a href="https://www.harvardwecode.com/" target="blank">Women Engineers Code</a>, 
			<a href="https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/" target="blank"> Harvard Computer Society</a>,
			<a href="https://www.harvardwics.com/" target="blank">Harvard Women in Computer Science</a> and 
			<a href="https://www.hodp.org/" target="blank">Harvard Open Data Project</a>. I also worked as a 
			research fellow this past summer in Harvard's Earth and Planetary Sciences department developing graphical models of climate data in Python. 
			
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now, I am collaborating within a team of 3 to create a new time management app in React. I also am finishing up a to-do list style music practice app
			in React and command-line Java. Through various school projects, I have created a grade checker in Java and a Tideman voting system algorithm, message encryption program,
			and photo filtering program in C.
	
		<p>
			I graduated from Oliver M. Hazen High School in June 2020. While there, I founded a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> chapter, captained the school's cross country team for two consective years, served as a section leader in the school band program, and served the community as part of the National Honor Society.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			One of my passions is to mentor and helper younger peers. I have previously worked as an intern counselor with <a href="https://www.girlsrockmathematics.com" target="_blank">Girls Rock Math</a> and currently work with the <a href="https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org" target="_blank">Pacific Science Center</a> summer camps to educate elementary students in STEM related curriculums. I have also been tutoring privately for about 3 years.
