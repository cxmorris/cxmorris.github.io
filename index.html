		<h2>About me</h2>
	<div class="about">
		<p>
			I am a freshman intending to study computer science and economics at Harvard University. 
		</p>
	
		<p>
			I graduated from Oliver M. Hazen High School in June 2020. While there, I founded a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> chapter, captained the school's cross country team for two consective years, served as a section leader in the school band program, and served the community as part of the National Honor Society.

		<p>
			One of my passions is to mentor and helper younger peers. I have previously worked as an intern counselor with <a href="https://www.girlsrockmathematics.com" target="_blank">Girls Rock Math</a> and currently work with the <a href="https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org" target="_blank">Pacific Science Center</a> summer camps to educate elementary students in STEM related curriculums. I have also been tutoring privately for about 3 years.
